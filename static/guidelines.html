<li>You may invite your alt to the clan if it is a non-rushed TH13 or better; TH13 accounts will be used to boost war numbers and are not considered full member accounts. If the clan is full some may be requested to leave temporarily.
<li>The clan manager records your donations even if you leave and return. Donations for the current month and the previous month are listed beside your promotion level and availability status. The first number is the current donations and the number in brackets are donations given prior to leaving the clan and coming back for the respective month.

<h3>CWL Rank</h3>
CWL bonuses are awarded based on the 'mod' column of the player table, which can be found <a style="color: gold;" href="/cwl">here</a>. The following CWL ranking calculation is used
<ul style="font-size: 0.7em">
<li>+ 30</li>
<li>+ (3 * Attack Stars)</li>
<li>- Defense Stars</li> 
<li>+ The number of rounds you are fighting</li>
<li>+ Donation modifier based on the previous months donations up to +6</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ore Farming</h3>
There is a secondary feeder clan available, which is used for farming ore during CWL. You can join the clan by clicking 
<a style="color: gold;" href="https://link.clashofclans.com/en?action=OpenClanProfile&tag=2Q9RU822V">here</a>. 
Once the CWL sign up period has ended notifications will be given in game so you can move over and sign up for a normal war thereby doing both CWL and normal war in parallel.

<h2>Choosing Targets</h2>
<a id='target'></a>
First attack should always be your mirror, if your mirror has been defeated you are free to choose your target using the following guidelines in order of importance
<ol>
<li>Obtaining stars; if you can reasonably be expected to get stars then you should
<li>Attack as high up the map as you can; You certainly shouldn't be attacking more than three castles below unless there is not a reasonable chance of obtaining a star higher up the map
<li>Any castle if there is less than four hours remaining in the war and you can obtain multiple stars
</ol>
